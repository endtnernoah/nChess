package game

/*
	This will hold logic for:
	- Turn based move making
	- Holding all rules for a game (50 move rule, 75 move rule...)
	- Checking the state for checkmate...
	- Allows for 2 player interface objects that will hold something like a getNextMove(*position, *legalMoves????)
	- Somehow needs to validate if a move is valid?
	- Maybe the game will validate that
	- AI Interface needs to hold the engine for search
